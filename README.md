### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Assistant/Statistician within the [HIV Inference Group](https://hiv-inference.org/) at Imperial College London. 
My research focuses on the use of Bayesian and spatiotemporal statistics in Global Health, specifically in modelling the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (and even more specifically, in modelling [male circumcision coverage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09142.pdf) there (for which I am actively developing the R package [`threemc`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/threemc))). 

I am proficient in R (mainly using the `tidyverse`, `data.table` and `sf` for data manipulation, [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) for reproducible reporting, and `TMB`, `INLA` and `rstan` for Bayesian inference) and also have a limited knowledge of Python (mainly `numpy` and `skikitlearn` for machine learning) and C++. 

I am originally from Laois in Ireland, and in 2020 completed a B.Sc. in Statistics at Univesity College Dublin. I have worked previously as a Statistician at [Airfinity](https://www.airfinity.com/), helping to estimate and forecast global Covid-19 vaccinations and vaccine supply and production for major stakeholders, and as an Intern Statistician at [Lubrizol](https://www.lubrizol.com/), building predictive models for speciality chemicals. 

I am actively looking for a PhD position in Bayesian statistics, so if you are taking on students, or know of any good programmes, please get in touch! I can be contacted at paddy7wb dot gmail dot com.

Outside of work, my main hobbies are [hurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling) (often described as a cross of lacrosse and field hockey) and [Gaelic football]() (often described as a cross between rugby and soccer), although I've had little success with either. I also enjoy a pint, although that can sometimes be a [treacherous pastime in my current abode](https://twitter.com/shitlondonguinn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
